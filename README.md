# Rainfall Prediction Model

This project focuses on predicting rainfall using various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC). The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Steps

Import Libraries
   - Import the necessary libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and model training.

Load Dataset
   - Load the rainfall dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis 
   - Conduct EDA to understand the dataset, including visualizing the distribution of rainfall categories and plotting distributions of numerical features.
   - Use boxplots and heatmaps to detect outliers and visualize correlations between features.

Data Preprocessing
   - Split the dataset into training and validation sets.
   - Use oversampling techniques to handle class imbalance.
   - Standardize the features to improve model performance.

Model Training
   - Train three machine learning models: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and SVC.
   - Evaluate each modelâ€™s performance using training and validation accuracy, as well as ROC-AUC scores.

Model Evaluation
   - Compare the classification reports and ROC-AUC scores to determine the best-performing model.
   - Provide insights on model accuracy and areas for improvement.
